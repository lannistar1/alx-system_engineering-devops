# `Web stack debugging #3`
Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).

Hint:

strace can attach to a current running process
You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one
